## Application: [https://train-check.now.sh/](https://train-check.now.sh/)

## About

This is a project to check train delay times on the JR system.

Built using React, Node.js, Bootstrap, and other technologies.

The accessed API is undocumented, so hopefully it continues to function.
Due to API limitations, this application can show delay times and the train's current location, but scheduled arrival time data is unavailable.
