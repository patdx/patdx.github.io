## About

This is a project to check train delay times on the JR
system.

Built using React, Node.js, Bootstrap, and other
technologies.

The accessed API is undocumented, and unfortunately no
longer seems to function correctly.

Due to API limitations, this application can show delay
times and the train's current location, but scheduled
arrival time data is unavailable.
